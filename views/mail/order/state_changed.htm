Hi {{ order.customer.firstname }}

We just wanted to let you know that your order **#{{ order.order_number }}** now
has a new status of **{{ order.order_state.name }}**.

{% partial 'mall.order.tracking' order=order %}

{% partial 'button' url=app_url type='primary' body %}
    Check your order online

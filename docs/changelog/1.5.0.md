# v1.5.0

## Changes

* Services can now be managed in the backend and can be added to products
* The `mallDependencies` component now injects a global `.mall-modal` element
into the DOM

## Required actions

### `mallDependencies`

Make sure the `mallDependencies` component is added to your layout's
`<head>` tag, and is not just included in the code section.

```twig
[mallDependencies]
==
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    {% component 'mallDependencies' %}
</head>
```

### `.mall-modal` styles

If you make use of the new `Services` feature, make sure to style the
`.mall-modal` element. 

For styling inspiration take a look at [the commit to the demo theme](https://github.com/OFFLINE-GmbH/oc-mall-theme/commit/6660c9572f268164e031b9496366d0d82bd65003).


### `mall.cart.productAdded` event

If you did override the `components/product/default.htm` partial, make sure
to only fire the `mall.cart.productAdded` event if the `data` object
has a `added` key with the value of `true`.

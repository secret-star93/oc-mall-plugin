## Required actions

### Update RainLab.Translate 

Update `RainLab.Translate` to version `1.6.3` to be compatible
with this release. 

Version `1.6.3` enables eager-loading of translated attributes.
This decreases the overall query count on all pages. 

### Update product component partials

If you override the `properties/color.htm` or `properties/default.htm`
partials of the `Product` component, make sure to use 
new value accessors to properly load translations.

See [Commit](https://github.com/OFFLINE-GmbH/oc-mall-plugin/commit/4ba95c8808dda658e255d2688efaeae69f5ec8e9)

If you override the `tax-info.htm` partial of the `Product` component,
make sure to uses the new `filteredTaxes` attribute to only display the
correct taxes for the user's current shipping destination country.

### Optional: Use included "Proceed to checkout button"

The `Cart` component got a new `showProceedToCheckout` property that includes
a "Proceed to checkout" button with the component if enabled. The button will be
removed correctly if a user removes all products from the cart. Until now
it was not possible to remove the button if it was placed on a theme partial.

This change is opt-in. If you don't explicitly set the new property to true,
the component output will be unchanged.

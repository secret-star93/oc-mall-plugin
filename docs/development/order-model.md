# Order model

The `Order` model represents a customer's completed order.

A `Order` model is created as soon as the customer hits the checkout button.
The order is persisted even if the payment fails. This enables a 
customer to retry the payment at any time.

## Payment ID for offline payments

If you offer offline payments you might want to have a unique payment ID to 
identify any incoming payments. This can be done using the `payment_hash` attribute
on the Order model.

```php
echo $order->id;
=> 17
echo $order->payment_hash;
=> "ng4gNkm5"
```

The `payment_hash` is presented to the shop admin on the orders backend page.

### Display offline payment info in checkout mails

You could add the following code to the `offline.mall::mail.checkout.succeeded` mail template:

```twig
{% if not order.isPaid %}
    {% partial 'panel' body %}
        The payment for this order is still pending.
        
        Please send **{{ order.totalPostTaxes.string }}** to the following bank account:
        
        <Your bank connection>
        Payment reason: {{ order.payment_hash }}
    {% endpartial %}
{% endif %}
```   

## Access pricing information

You can access the following price relationships on the `Order` model. Refer
to the [pricing information](./pricing-information.md) page for more
information on how to use these.
